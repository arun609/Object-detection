🎯 Object Detection Using YOLOv7

---
📖 Overview

The **Object Detection Project** uses the YOLOv7 (**You Only Look Once**) model to detect and classify objects in images and videos. YOLOv7 is a cutting-edge, real-time object detection framework known for its **speed**, **efficiency**, and **accuracy**.
The model analyzes input frames, identifies multiple objects, and returns:

* **Bounding Boxes**
* **Class Labels**
* **Confidence Scores**

This enables **real-time processing**, making it ideal for applications like **autonomous vehicles**, **surveillance systems**, **retail analytics**, and **smart city solutions**.

  Leverages YOLOv7’s speed for instant inference on live video and images.

* 📦 **Bounding Box Prediction:**
  Precisely locates objects within the frame.

* 🏷️ **Class Labels:**
  Identifies objects such as person, car, bottle, etc.

* 📊 **Confidence Scores:**
  Shows the probability of each prediction.

* 🧠 **PyTorch Implementation:**
  Fully implemented in PyTorch for flexibility and performance.

* 🖼️ **Integration with OpenCV:**
  For image I/O, frame resizing, and drawing prediction overlays.

* 🧮 **Data Analysis with Pandas:**
  Logs prediction data, counts, and class-wise occurrences.

* 📈 **Optional Visualization with Matplotlib:**
  For plotting prediction results and performance summaries.

 🔁 Workflow Steps

1️⃣ Set Up the Environment

* Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed
* Clone YOLOv7 repo and set up the environment
* Install required dependencies

2️⃣ Prepare the Dataset

* Use an existing dataset like **COCO** or **Pascal VOC**
* Or prepare a **custom dataset**
* Annotate with tools like **LabelImg**
* Convert annotations to YOLO format

3️⃣ Preprocess the Data

* Resize and normalize images
* Split into `train/val/test` folders
* Optionally use a preprocessing script

4️⃣ Train the Model

* Load YOLOv7 with `train.py`
* Configure:

  * `data.yaml` for dataset paths & classes
  * `hyp.yaml` for hyperparameters
* Set training configs (batch size, epochs, learning rate)
* Monitor training using logs and TensorBoard

5️⃣ Evaluate the Model

* Use `test.py` to test on unseen data
* Evaluate:

  * **Precision**, **Recall**
  * **mAP (mean Average Precision)**
* Analyze misclassified outputs

6️⃣ Run Inference

* Use `detect.py` to test on:

  * Images
  * Videos
  * Webcam feeds
* Model outputs:

  * Bounding boxes
  * Class names
  * Confidence scores

7️⃣ Visualize Results

* Draw results using OpenCV (live)
* Optionally, log data with Pandas and visualize with Matplotlib

8️⃣ Optimization (Optional)

* Apply:

  * **Pruning**
  * **Quantization**
  * **ONNX Conversion**
* Deploy on edge devices for real-time performance
